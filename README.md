**ProtegeDados_ProjetoFinal** -  My final project, real time integrity monitoring and access filtering using minifilter. 

Description
===========

Microsoft Windows real time file integrity monitoring and filtering using minifilter technology, this is was my university final project. 
The idea of the project is to create a new layer of security, monitoring unwanted files change. Creating a new access rule with levels of
access to authorized processes. All mechanisms are controlled by the generated hash from files and processes.

Status
======

While running this code was not really tested in production or large loads, the idea was just to generate a proof of concept.
Is good for anyone who wants to study about minifilters.
